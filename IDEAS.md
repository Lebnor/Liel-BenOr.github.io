# Website Overhaul Ideas

## Concept: "Website Throughout History"
Keep the old 2022 content intentionally, deliver a contrast between old and new eras.

## Idea 1: The Torn Page

- Jagged vertical tear runs down the center of the page
- All content exists in both old (2022) and new (2026) styles
- **Default state**: a narrow middle zone where both styles are visible — old peeking left, new peeking right — teasing the contrast
- **Hover left half**: old 2022 style seeps outward from the tear line, washing leftward until it fills the left half
- **Hover right half**: new modern style seeps outward from the tear line, washing rightward until it fills the right half
- The tear line is the origin point — styles "bleed" from the crack
- New side features: fancy animations, modern design, AI-era content
- Old side: preserves the original 2022 look and feel
